# Data-visualization-and-summary-statistics

This repo consists of my importing a datset on commutes in St.Louis.
I created a summary statistics report, a scatterplot matrix for all
of the numerical variables, a boxplot of distance traveled by gender, 
created a scatter plot with a linear regression line, and a
residual plot.
